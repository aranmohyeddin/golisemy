# golisemy
This is the github repository for organising and tracking our research into polysemous words.

# ideas:
* Replace yellow with banana, learn the new vector, find the relation between the three vectors(pure banana, pute yellow, merged banellow), do the same for cucumber and green, etc... That could lead to a fantastic model for predicting this class of regular polysemy. Similar approach can be used on many other classes.
* K-learns: split apples into apple_1(company) and apple_2(fruit) and learn both vectors. Then use these vectors as centroids and split based on distance from these centroids and repeat until convergence. What this does will hopefully be that it starts with a split that was generated by a weak guess, and get to a high quality dataset.
